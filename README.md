# ThinkLoom

**Applied AI. Open Innovation. Future Loomed Together.**

ThinkLoom is a collaborative space where we design, prototype, and share practical AI solutions.  
Our focus: turning complex AI workflows into tools that are **usable, transparent, and impactful** for businesses and developers.

---

## 🚀 What We’re About
At ThinkLoom, we believe AI should be:
- **Accessible** → Lowering the entry barrier for teams and individuals.  
- **Practical** → Building tools that solve *real-world* problems.  
- **Open** → Sharing utilities, frameworks, and ideas with the community.  
- **Extendable** → Every PoC should have a path to grow into production-ready systems.  

---

## 🧩 Current Directions
We’re experimenting and releasing projects around:

- **DocuLoom** → Document AI / OCR pipelines (structured data extraction, schema-first workflows).  
- **VisionLoom** → Computer vision training + evaluation orchestration with Label Studio & custom workflows.  
- **AnnotaLoom** → Annotation and dataset management utilities.  
- **LLMfluence** → Exploring “AI SEO” for the new era of brand visibility with LLMs.  
- **TIEI Services** → Domain-specific extraction pipelines (Invoices, GRIN data, etc.).

## 🌱 Open Source Seeds
We’re starting small but useful:  
- Label & dataset cleanup utilities.  
- Schema generators for OCR projects.  
- Lightweight inference dashboards for images and text.  
- Minimal “prompt playgrounds” for experimenting with LLMs.  

These are designed to get **community traction** and **real-world usage** quickly.
