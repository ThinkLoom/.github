# 🌌 ThinkLoom

**Weaving AI into Everyday Workflows**

ThinkLoom is a product studio exploring the intersection of **AI, automation, and user-centric design**.
Our mission is to make advanced AI systems accessible, modular, and practical — from documents to vision to governance.

---

## 🚀 What We’re Building

ThinkLoom projects are designed as modular **“…Loom” platforms**, starting with PoCs and evolving into production-ready systems:

* **📑 DocuLoom** – OCR + structured data extraction.
  *Define schemas, annotate documents, train models, and run inference.*

* **👁️ VisionLoom** – Computer vision workflow orchestration.
  *From labeling to versioned training, evaluation, and real-time inference.*

* **🔍 AnnotaLoom** – Unified annotation environment.
  *Supports both document OCR and image datasets, integrated with Label Studio.*

* **📊 InsightLoom** – Centralized dashboards, monitoring, and reports for AI projects.

* **🛡️ GuardLoom** – Guardrails and governance for safe, responsible AI.

* **🌐 NeuroLoom** – Long-term vision to converge multimodal AI, orchestration, and creativity into a unified intelligence layer.

## 🧩 How We Work

* **Spec-First Development** – Inspired by GitHub’s own design system, we use a *Spec-Kit* approach: every project starts with clear specs before coding.
* **Open + Closed Source Strategy** – Some modules will be open-sourced for community adoption, while others remain proprietary SaaS offerings.
* **GitHub-Inspired Design** – Clean, developer-first UI built on a familiar workflow style.
* **Prediction Workflows** – Each Loom project bakes in *model versioning, inference, and retraining* from day one.

## 📂 Current Proof-of-Concepts

1. **DocuLoom OCR** – Schema-driven document extraction with model training + inference endpoints.
2. **VisionLoom PoC** – Object detection using YOLOv8, annotation pipeline, and live webcam inference.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **AI/ML**: PyTorch, YOLOv8, OCR engines, LLMs
* **Annotation**: Label Studio, CVAT
* **Backends**: Python, FastAPI
* **Frontends**: React (Primer-inspired UI)
* **Infra**: Docker, GitHub Codespaces, extensible workstation setup

---

## 🌱 Roadmap

* [ ] Stabilize **DocuLoom** + **VisionLoom** PoCs
* [ ] Launch developer-ready **Spec-Kit** framework
* [ ] Release initial open-source Loom tools
* [ ] Expand into **InsightLoom** + **GuardLoom**
* [ ] Grow toward **NeuroLoom** platform
